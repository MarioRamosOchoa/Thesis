    <h4 class="text"><strong>Private Loan
      </strong></h4>
    <p class="lead answer-text">
      A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school. These are alternatives in case your financial aid does not cover enough of your tuition. However, use them sparringly and not at all if possible. They
      will likely have higher interests than federal loans. Speak to your financial aid office and push for more financial aid because of your financial circumstances.
