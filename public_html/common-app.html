				</h4>
				<p class="lead answer-text">
					The Common Application, or Common App, is a single college application that can be sent to multiple colleges. While the application itself takes much longer to complete than a regular college application for one school, it saves time in the end. There is a form component, which asks you for your information, such as name, date of birth, etc. And there are 7 prompts that you must complete. There is a 650-word-limit to each one. You can find a full list of them further below.

			<h4 class="text"><strong>Is It Required for Applying to Colleges?
				</strong></h4>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				No, in fact, some schools don't even use the Common App. If the college you are looking to apply to has the application available outside of the Common App, then you are free to apply that way. However, the benefit of the Common App is that
				you don't have to keep filling out all of those forms. It makes the entire process more efficient.

			<h4 class="text"><strong>How Do I Use It?
				</strong></h4>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				First you will need to create an account. It is recommended to use a specific email for all college application websites. That way you will have all of them in one place. Next you will fill out your basic information. It will ask you a ton of
				questions on your date of birth, where you live, etc. Once this step is done, you can add schools to your list. These schools will receive your application. There are over 800 to choose from.

			<p class="lead answer-text">
				Each school could have their own specific requirements. This could be in the form of the GPA, transcripts, letters of recommendation, test scores, essay prompts, etc. You will have to make sure you fulfill each of these prerequisites before

			<p class="lead answer-text">
				For the top schools on your list, you might want to apply to them first for Early Action or Early Decision. A good rule of thumb is to apply to the schools with the earliest deadlines first. But usually schools have very similar due dates.

			<h4 class="text"><strong>What Do the Essay Prompts Look Like?
				</strong></h4>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				The 2019-2020 essay prompts will be the same as the last two years. There are seven of them in total and they have a range of themes. Get started on them as soon as possible. Make sure to proof read, have teachers or counselors look over
				them, and ask for as much advice as you can before you click submit. You can view the Common App blog post about this <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/whats-appening/application-updates/2019-2020-common-app-essay-prompts">here.</a>
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				1. Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				2. The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				3. Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				4. Describe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you
				and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				5. Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				6. Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?
			</p>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				7. Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.

		<div class="col-xs-4 col-md-10 offset-md-1">
			<h4 class="text"><strong>Can I Reuse Essays for Different Colleges?
				</strong></h4>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				Often college applicants feel as though they need to change their essays and applications for each school, however, this is not the case. If two colleges ask the same essay question then feel free to submit the same one. Schools won't
				talk to each other about the students that apply to them. So, go ahead and send in that awesome essay to as many schools as you'd like.

	<div class="row text-left QnA">
		<div class="col-xs-4 col-md-10 offset-md-1">
			<h4 class="text"><strong>When Should I Begin My Application?
				</strong></h4>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				Ideally, the sooner you begin those applications, the better. Senior year of high school can be very stressfull. You will likely be juggling multiple things at once, such as clubs, sports, band, homework, and final exams. Those things become
				much harder to do if you add writing college applications and applications to the mix. A good rule of thumb is to begin those applications the summer before senior year. The application opens on August 1st. If you start on that day, you will still have a few months of
				summer vacation before you begin. Try to get as much done in that time so that you can enjoy more free time during the school year.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				Another tip is to set frequent, achievable deadlines for yourself. Sure, most university applications aren't due until January 15th, but you don't want to wait until the week before to start them. Set deadlines like completing one essay
				question every 2 weeks. This allows you to continually make progress towards your goal and it alleviates the stress on yourself in January.

			<h4 class="text"><strong>What Colleges Should I Apply To?
				</strong></h4>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				You can use the Common App's explore colleges tool. They help you find schools based on various criteria. It is a simple and handy tool to use. Good questions to ask yourself when looking for colleges is how far do you want to be from home,
				what majors do the schools have, is it a big school or a small school, how much does the school cost, how much financial aid can this school provide me. Think of what YOU want out of college and use that to help your search. If you need more
				help, as one of your high school counselors or teachers. You can <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/explore-colleges" target="_blank">access the tool here.</a>
