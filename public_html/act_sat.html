					Math: This section is 60 minutes long with 60 questions. These questions can range from pre-algebra, algebra, to geometry, and trigonometry. You will be able to use a graphing or scientific calculator in this section, so that will hopefully

					Reading: Time is shortened on this one, as you will have 35 minutes to answer 40 questions. There will be four big sections: Three of them are different passages and the last section has two shorter prose passages. The Reading section is
					meant
					to test your ability to quickly identify the main ideas of a passage and the structure the author(s) used. You will likely encounter questions that ask you to find the meaning of a part of the text.

					You will only complete this section if you want. It will not affect any of the scores you get for the previous section. Instead, you will get a separate writing score. This section is done at the very end of the ACT.
					You will have 40
					minutes to write a well constructed essay on a given prompt. How will your essay be graded? Two trained readers, usually high school teachers that volunteer to do so, will read your paper and give it a score from 1 to 6. The higher the
					score,
					the better you did. The readers will be looking for how well you did in each of the following sections: Ideas and Analysis, Development and Support, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Once they judge each section, the scores are
					added
					up. If reader 1 says that your essay deserves a 3 on Organization but reader 2 says you deserve a 6, then a third reader comes in and analyzes your paper. The third reader makes the final decision.

					<strong>
						Its Okay to Be Nervous!
					</strong>
				</h4>
				<p class="lead answer-text">
					This all sounds super scary. But the fear goes away once you're in the middle of doing the exam. Focus on the test and answering the questions as best as possible. If you don't know the answer to a particular question and you're taking too
					much
					time on it, then just guess and move on. If you have time at the end, come back to it. But if you use up a ton of time on each question, you won't get all the way through. Its better to guess on those questions and get through the entire
					test,
					rather than answer 1/4 of the questions correctly and not complete the test.

							On test day you will <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/taking-the-test/test-day-checklist" target="_blank">bring all the required items to take the test.</a> There will likely be multiple lines. They often are
							organized
							alphabetically by last name, so you might find a line for A-L, another for M-R, and S-Z, or some variation of this. Fine your correct line and make your way through. They will check that all of the information you bring is correct. If
							it
							is,
							you will admitted into the test. If it is not, they will pull you aside and likely tell you that you cannot take the test today. In that case you will have to reschedule for another time.
						</p>

						<p class="lead answer-text">
							Go to your testing room that the administrators provide. Sit in a seat that looks comfortable. Once everyone in your test group is in the room and seated, the test administrator will read aloud the instructions. Listened up because that
							information is important. They will then ask if there are any questions. Finally, you will be begin your test. At the end of the exam the test assistant will collect all packets and you are free to go. To find out when you will receive

							Make sure the name on your page matches your ID. When filling out the form for the SAT, you will need to input your full name. This includes middle names and multiple last names, if those apply to you. Then you will have to print out a
							sheet
							with all of your information and take it into the test center. Once there, the assistants there will ask for a form of identification, <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/taking-the-test/id-requirements"
								target="_blank">here is list of acceptable forms of ID.</a> <strong>Make sure the name on your ID and the name on your paper match perfectly.</strong> If you go by your middle name and thus put that on the SAT paper, but your ID shows
							only
							first name, they will not let you in. They are very strict about this so be careful.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="lead">
							Bring a bag of snacks! You will definitely get hungry during the test and hunger will make you perform worse overall. Instead of thinking about how to solve the math problem you're currently on, you might be thinking of how you would
							love
							to
							be eating a huge stack of pancakes right about now. Plus it makes your stomach growl, which will take even more of the attention off of your test. I'd recommend Cliff bars, cereal bars, fruit, and a drink, like water or juice. These are
							easy
							and quick to eat, while still making you feel full.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="lead">
							Show up early. There is always a line to take these sorts of test. The quicker you go through the line, the better. This way you will be able to get in sooner and pick out a seat that works best for you in the testing room. If the seat
							you
							first sit in is squeaky, get up and find another, no one likes a squeaky chair. If some of your friends are also taking the test with you, you can sit next to some of them, which can ease your stress a bit. Additionally, by being in the
							room
							for a longer period of time, you will be more accustomed to the test setting. The tests can be scary and jarring. If you show up late and rush into the room only to start taking the test soon after can be stressful.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="lead">
							If you don't know the answer, guess. My AP Lit teacher in high school taught us helpful tips for the SAT and ACT. Read the question carefully. If you don't know the answer, first try eliminating the answers that you
							<strong>know</strong>
							are
							wrong. Once you eliminated all those, then guess. Statistically, I there are 4 possible answers, you have increased your odds by 25% with every answer you eliminated. So, if you eliminated 2 responses as possible answers, that leaves 2
							left.
							If you purely guess from this, statistically you have a 50% chance of getting it right! That is better than 25% you started with originally.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="lead">
							So why would you guess when you can take your time to find the right answer? Well, in these sorts of test, as well as the AP tests, time is very limited. Often times you will run out of time before you can answer all of the questions.
							So
							when
							you run into questions where you have absolutely no idea what the right answer is, instead of taking 5 minutes to carefully pick out an answer, just eliminate options and guess. That will save you a lot of time. Now, if you get through
							the
							entire section and still have time at the end, go back to these questions that you guessed on and see if you can answer them now. It is often the case that you encounter a question later on in the packet that jogs your mind and reminds
							you
							of
							how to do a previous one.
