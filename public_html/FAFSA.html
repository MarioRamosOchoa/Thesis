				<p class="lead answer-text">
					The Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) is a federal form that students attending or preparing to attend college can complete. By completing this form, you will receive a number known as an Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). This
					number indicates how much money you and your family is able to contribute directly to your tuition. For example, an EFC of 000342 means your family is expected to pay around $342 per year to your school.

		<div class="col-xs-4 col-md-10 offset-md-1">
			<h3 class="text"><strong>Why is an EFC important?</strong>
			</h3>
			<p class="lead answer-text">Colleges and Universities use this EFC to determine your federal student aid eligibility. The lower your EFC, the less you're expected to pay and therefore the more aid you can receive. This can be in the form of
				federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, scholarships, grants, and other forms of money that help pay your tuition. A lower EFC is better in terms of the amount of aid you can receive. It is important to note that the EFC does not
				determine how much money you will receive from the college, but rather is how much you are eligible to receive. The college will ultimately determine how much and in what form (scholarship, loans, work-study) you will receive the amount
				of aid they provide.
				<br />
				In addition, after completing the FAFSA, you will receive an estimate on how of the Pell Grant and Stafford Loans you are eligible for. The Pell Grant is offered to those with "exceptional financial need" and have not completed their
				bachelor's degree. Since Pell Grants is a form of a grant, you will not have to repay the money they provide. Stafford Loans are federal loans that can come in subsidized and unsubsidized variants. Grants and these types of loans are
				covered in much more depth in the <a href="college-terminology.html">terminology section.</a>

			<h3 class="text"><strong>
					How is the EFC determined?

				</strong>
			</h3>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				The FAFSA form will ask you a ton of different questions regarding your income, your parents income, assets (such as a business or property owned), how many people are in your household, tax information, and other questions that determine
				how much funding you can provide to your education. The FAFSA requires you be correct and honest in the responses you give in order to determine the most accurate EFC.

			<h3 class="text"><strong>
					Is the FAFSA required to Attend College?
				</strong>
			</h3>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				The FAFSA is not required. It is a service that is provided by the federal government if you need federal assistance and aid in order to pay for your college tuition. You can forgo the FAFSA and pay everything out of pocket if that suits
				your financial needs better or if you are not eligible to apply for the FAFSA.

					When Should I Submit the FAFSA?
				</strong></h3>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				Ideally, the sooner the better. It may be the case that you can receive more aid based on when you submit it. Some schools have limited aid, therefore, the sooner, the better.

					Do I Have to Complete it in One Session?
				</strong></h3>
			<p class="lead answer-text">
				No, you can finish as much as you want to and save as a draft. When you log back in, select the application and continue from where you left off from. This application is pretty extensive. It helps if you have submitted one before, but that may not be the case. Also, importing data from your parent or guardian's IRS tax statements makes things so much easier. It takes couple button presses but once it is imported, you have possibly saved a couple hours of work.

				That is totally okay! FAFSA is pretty confusing and kind of scary. It is one of the first experiences you might have when it comes to paying for college. This can be incredibly scary. But there are a ton of resources out there to help you
				pay for college. Money shouldn't be the deciding factor between you going to your dream school or not. <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa" target="_blank">Visit the FAFSA website</a> for more information, as their site has everything
